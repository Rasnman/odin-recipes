        <h3>A classic of classics, the drink contains whiskey and is considered one of the first cocktails in history - hence its name.</h3>

        <p>According to cocktail historian David Wondrich, the Old Fashioned is a direct descendant of the earliest known cocktail, 
        which in 1806 consisted of "a little water, a little sugar, a lot of liquor and a couple splashes of bitters." Purists may 
        scoff at the inclusion of a muddled cherry, but if it brings you pleasure, don't hold back.</p>
