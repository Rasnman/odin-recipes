        <h1><em>1. Old Fashioned</em></h1>
        <h3>A classic of classics, the drink contains whiskey and is considered one of the first cocktails in history - hence its name.</h3>
        <img src="../../images/old-fashioned.webp" alt="Old Fashioned cocktail in a glass with an orange twist and a cherry" height="500" width="750">
        <p>According to cocktail historian David Wondrich, the Old Fashioned is a direct descendant of the earliest known cocktail, 
        which in 1806 consisted of "a little water, a little sugar, a lot of liquor and a couple splashes of bitters." Purists may 
        scoff at the inclusion of a muddled cherry, but if it brings you pleasure, don't hold back.</p>

        <!-- INGREDIENTS SECTION BY LISTS -->

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Bourbon or rye whiskey</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is the main ingredient, so you’ll want to pick a quality bottle. 
                    It doesn’t have to be expensive — it just has to be one you like! 
                    Some of my favorites are Basil Hayden’s, Four Roses, and Rowan’s Creek.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><h3>Bitters</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Aromatic Angostura bitters add depth to the cocktail.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><h3>Sugar</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>A little demerara sugar or regular granulated takes a little bit of the bourbon bite out of the cocktail.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><h3>Orange</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Twist the peel over the glass before adding so the orange oils enhance the aroma of the cocktail.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><h3>Cherries</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>While optional, a speared Luxardo cherry adds a nice final touch.</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
