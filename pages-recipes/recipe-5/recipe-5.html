        <h1><em>5. Revolver</em></h1>
        <h3>More than a decade before the Espresso Martini’s resurgence, San Francisco gifted us this ‘Espresso Manhattan.’</h3>

        <p>Essentially an "Espresso Manhattan," this cocktail combines bourbon, coffee liqueur, and orange bitters. Use Bulleit 
            bourbon for the higher amount of rye in its mash if you'd like to pay homage to the traditional Manhattan's rye whiskey base.</p>

                    <li><strong>I would recommend using a high-proof rye whiskey. My go-to whiskey for 
                        cocktails is Rittenhouse 100, a 100 proof rye (50% ABV) that usually works great in 
                        a manhattan or an old fashion. It is also delicious with bourbon, like Russell's Reserve. 
                        Still, I find the rye slightly more interesting and complex, with the rye spiciness contrasting 
                        with the sweetness of the coffee liqueur.</strong></li>
